I first got involved in tagging animals at mote when I was an intern and then research technician with Dr. Nick Whitney. I worked on a project where we tagged Blacktip sharks using recreational fishing methods to assess the species post release mortality. From this project I became involved in other projects such as juvenile sea turtle behavior.

### Saltwater Inc.
