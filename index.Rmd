Currently I am a graduate student in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University](https://oeb.harvard.edu/). I am broadly interested in Ecology. My primary interests are using interdiscipliary approaches integrating technology to anwser questions about animal movement and behavior.
